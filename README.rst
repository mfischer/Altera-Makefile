============================
 Altera Quartus II Makefile
============================

This can be used to compile your altera projects on the commandline,
i.e. without the GUI.

Directory Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As Quartus II will throw a lot of garbage into its project dir,
a directory layout as follows was picked::
  
  fpga/
  nios/
  quartus/

Your HDL code (and also the stuff that you might generate by using QSys)
goes into *fpga/*.
The quartus directory will contain all the stuff that gets generated by quartus.

Usage
~~~~~~

In order to use this to build your project, drop all your HDL code into fpga.
Edit *quartus/Makefile* to suit your needs, most interesting variables there
should be:

* SRCS (your HDL code)
* PROJECT (your projects name?)
* TOP_LEVEL_ENTITY (your projects top level entity)
* FAMILY, PART and BOARDFILE (for pin assignments, and part selection)

Now you can create and build your project by::

  user$: make -C quartus
 
In order to program the FPGA device use::

  user$: make program

Known problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If you generated some components using QSys check the paths in the
  corresponding _hw.tcl file and make sure the _hw.tcl file is 
  *inside* (for now ...) the *quartus/* directory.
